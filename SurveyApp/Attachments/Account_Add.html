Dear _FULLNAME_
<br /><br />
Thank you very much for participating in the UCSF PRONTO Outcomes Study!
<br /><br />
For this study we will use eBit, an online platform that facilitates caregivers in systematically completing and coordinating assessments.  Please use below information to <a href='_ROOTPATH_'>login</a> and complete assessment surveys assigned to you. Please note that these assessments are assigned at various intervals and would need to be completed within the specified time window.  Once you login, you would be able to see if there are any assessments assigned at that point and their corresponding due dates.
